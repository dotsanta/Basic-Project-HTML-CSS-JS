To-Do List Web App
A simple web application that allows users to create and manage a to-do list.

How to Use
Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
Click on a task to mark it as completed, or click on the "X" button to delete it from the list.
Your to-do list will be automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so you can access it again later.
If your project has any dependencies or prerequisites, list them in a separate section.
